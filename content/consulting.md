As well being the Lead Scientist for Bioinformatics in the [Drug Discovery Unit](http://www.cruk.manchester.ac.uk/Research/CRUK-MI-Groups/Drug-Discovery/Home) at the [Cancer Research UK Manchster Institute](http://www.cruk.manchester.ac.uk/), I am also an independent bioinformatics and data science consultant.  My specialisms are preclinical drug discovery and cancer genetics, but take a look at my blog and projects to see if I might be able to help you!
